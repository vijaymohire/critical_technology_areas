Advanced computing and software technologies include supercomputing, cloud computing, data storage, computing architectures, and data processing. Software is ubiquitous throughout the Department, but the speed at which software develops outpaces the Department's ability to stay up to date. The Department must rapidly modernize its legacy software systems with resilient, affordable, and assured new software that has been designed, developed, and tested using processes that establish confidence in its performance. The Department must migrate to a Development-Security-Operations (DevSecOps) approach in its software development and evolve to a model of continuous development, continuous test, and continuous delivery. The Department must leverage modular open system architecture approaches to isolate hardware from software and enable rapid upgrades to secure processors.

At Bhadale IT, we have years of experience in this area and have design ideas for the "IT Hub"
