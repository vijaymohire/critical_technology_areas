Microelectronics are circuits and components that serve as the "brain" to human-made electronic functional systems. Virtually every military and commercial system relies on microelectronics. Diminishing microelectronics manufacturing in the United States and supply chain concerns have highlighted national economic and security risks. Working closely with industry, academia, and across the Government, the Department is addressing the need for secure microelectronics sources and will leverage state-of-the-art commercial development and production for defense microelectronic solutions.

Nanoelectronics leads to the quantum scale electronics. This is a prerequisite for migrating microelectronics to the quantum paradigm. Involves nano scale particle study, quantum mechanics, nanostructures, and related instruments to design, develop nanosystems that can also extend to the DNA computing and Biological nano sensors etc
