Hypersonic systems fly within the atmosphere for significant portions of their flight at or above 5 times the speed of sound, or approximately 3700 miles per hour. Hypersonics dramatically shorten the timeline to strike a target and increase unpredictability. While strategic competitors are pursuing and rapidly fielding advanced hypersonic missiles, the company will develop leap-ahead and cost-effective technologies for our air, land, and sea operational forces.
